Hello! I am a Software Engineering student, currently in my last year. I hold a Master’s degree in Business Intelligence, where I specialized in data-driven decision-making and analytics.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and business needs, with a strong interest in software engineering, backend development, and distributed systems. My academic and project experience has allowed me to work with modern technologies and explore fields like operations research and system design. I am particularly interested in generative AI applications and how they can transform the way we learn, create, and interact with technology.

I strongly believe that web technologies are meant to serve humanity-making knowledge, collaboration, and opportunities more accessible to all, as well as improving human decision-making. My interests include software engineering, distributed systems, data-driven applications, and the future of AI in shaping impactful solutions.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy engaging in volunteering work. One of my deep goals is to create a positive impact on humanity. For this reason, I volunteer with the association tous inclus, helping to develop SaaS solutions that promote inclusion for people with special needs, such as individuals with disabilities or the elderly. In addition, I also contribute to other associations like animal saving and well-being.

I strongly believe in continuous learning and using technology to make a meaningful difference in society. <br />
